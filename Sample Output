TEMPERATURE TEST PROGRAM

Author: Constance Conner

Author: Luke Skywalker

Date: March 08, 2006

Course: CS 111B -Temperature Application

Test case 1: default constructor and

writeOutput() method.

Results of default constructor:

Verify 0 degrees C.

Temperature = 0.0 degrees C.

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 2: readInput() method.

Enter a temperature in degress (for example 29.6):

29.6

Enter 'F' (or 'f') for Fahrenheit or 'C' (or 'c') for Celsius:

F

Verify temperature and units:

Should be whatever you just entered.

Temperature = 29.6 degrees F.

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 3: constructor with just temperature.

Verify 20.5 degrees C.

Temperature = 20.5 degrees C.

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 4: constructor with just units, f.

Verify 0 degrees f.

Temperature = 0.0 degrees f.

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 5: constructor with just units, c.

Verify 0 degrees c.

Temperature = 0.0 degrees c.

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 6: constructor with temperature and units.

Verify -51.2 degrees F.

Temperature = -51.2 degrees F.

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 7: writeC degrees C, original in F.

Verify -46.2 degrees Celsius.

Temperature = -46.2 degrees Celsius.

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 8: writeC degrees C, original in C.

Verify 0 degrees Celsius.

Temperature = 0.0 degrees Celsius.

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 9: writeF degrees F, original in C.

Verify 32 degrees Fahrenheit

Temperature = 32.0 degrees Fahrenheit.

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 10: writeF degrees F, original in F.

Verify -51.2 degrees Fahrenheit

Temperature = -51.2 degrees Fahrenheit.

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 11: getF method with original temperature in F.

Verify -51.2

-51.2

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 12: getF method with original temperature in C.

Verify 32

32.0

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 13: getC method with original temperature in F.

Verify -46.2

-46.2

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 14: getC method with original temperature in C.

Verify 0

0.0

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 15: set method for both parameters.

t5 before:

Temperature = -51.2 degrees F.

After set: verify 72.8 degrees C.

Temperature = 72.8 degrees C.

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 16: set method for just temperature.

t5 before:

Temperature = 72.8 degrees C.

After set: verify 100 degrees C.

Temperature = 100.0 degrees C.

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 17: set method for just units.

t5 before:

Temperature = 100.0 degrees C.

After set: verify 100 degrees F.

Temperature = 100.0 degrees F.

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 18: equals test 1.

T1 = 100 degrees C.

T2 = 212 degrees F.

Here are the two temperatures converted to degrees C:

Temperature = 100.0 degrees Celsius.

Temperature = 100.0 degrees Celsius.

Verify results: should be true.

true

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 19: equals test 2.

T1 changed to 100.1 degrees C.

T2 = 212 degrees F.

Here are the two temperatures in degrees C:

Temperature = 100.1 degrees Celsius.

Temperature = 100.0 degrees Celsius.

Verify results: should be false.

false

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 20: equals test 3.

T1 changed back to 100 degrees C.

T2 = 212.1 degrees F.

Here are the two temperatures in degrees C:

Temperature = 100.0 degrees Celsius.

Temperature = 100.1 degrees Celsius.

Verify results: should be false.

false

Hit 'y' to continue.

y

Test case 21 (at last): toString method

T2 = 212.1 degrees F.

temperature 212.1F
